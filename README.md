# Week2 Unit3 JavaScript HW
Simple password generator, takes in some user criterias based on hw requirements.<br>
I used a set to make sure the generator used every character type selected.<br>
If canceled at start it will use the default of 8,true,true,true,true as inputs.<br>
If user tries to put in invalid input for length it will just re-ask until an ok response.<br>
If user doesnt select any type of characters a message will be displayed instead of a password.<br>
I originally didn't see there was code already and just did everything from scratch, then re-did with template<br>
